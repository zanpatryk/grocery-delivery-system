### Running the Project

To run the project, you need to first configure the `pom.xml` file to point to the `jade.jar` file. Due to issues with adding the `lib/jader.jar` folder to the remote repository, this step is necessary. Simply update the `pom.xml` with the correct path to `jade.jar` in your local environment. Once that is done, you can build and run the project as usual.
